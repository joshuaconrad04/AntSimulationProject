#README

The colony you create created consist of a queen and her brood, which will have workers
to gather food and scout the terrain surrounding the colony and soldiers to protect the colony
from enemies(Bala ants). The colony will start off with only the queen and a few workers and soldiers.
Over time the colony will expand to function like a real ant colony, to a limited extent.
Colony comes with different buttons and modes which influence the colony differently.
